#Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Jenkins Pipeline to Manage Roles and Users

#Objective: 
The objective of this SOP is to create a Jenkins pipeline that automates the process of managing roles and users using the Role-Based Strategy plugin. The pipeline will allow users to create new roles, add users to roles, and create new Jenkins users with specific roles and permissions.

#Prerequisites:

Jenkins server with Role-Based Strategy plugin installed and configured.
Jenkins API token and appropriate permissions to manage roles and users.                                                                  

#Step 1: Set Up Jenkins Global Configurations

Log in to the Jenkins server with the appropriate credentials.
Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure Global Security."
Under "Authorization," select "Role-Based Strategy."
Configure the desired role names and permissions for various tasks in Jenkins, such as "Read," "Administer," etc. Assign these permissions to the appropriate groups or users.
Under "Security Realm," select "Jenkins' own user database."
Tick the checkbox for "Allow users to sign up."
Click "Save" to save the changes to the global security configuration.

#Step 2: Set Up Jenkins Pipeline

Log in to the Jenkins server with the appropriate credentials.
Go to "New Item" and select "Pipeline" to create a new pipeline job.
Provide a name for the pipeline and choose the "Pipeline" option.
Scroll down to the "Pipeline" section, and in the "Definition" dropdown, select "Pipeline script."
Copy and paste the Jenkins pipeline code provided earlier into the "Script" section.
Click "Save" to save the pipeline configuration.

#Step 3: Configure Pipeline Parameters

In the pipeline configuration, navigate to the "Build with Parameters" section.
Add the following parameters:
ROLE_NAME: String parameter to specify the new role name.
NEW_USER: String parameter to specify the new user name.
USER_PERMISSION: Choice parameter to select the permission level for the new user (e.g., Read, Administer).
NEW_USER_PASSWORD1: Password parameter to set the new user's password.
NEW_USER_PASSWORD2: Password parameter to repeat the new user's password for confirmation.
NEW_USER_EMAIL: String parameter to specify the email address of the new user.

#Step 4: Implement Jenkins Pipeline Stages

Install jq: This stage installs the jq utility, which is used for JSON parsing.
Create Role: This stage creates a new role using the provided role name and user permission. It checks if the role already exists and prompts the user for a new role name if needed.
Create Jenkins User: This stage creates a new Jenkins user with the provided username, password, and email. It checks if the user already exists and prompts the user for a new username if needed.
Add User to Role: This stage adds the new user to the specified role. It fetches the existing role names and user names and prompts the user to select the role and user for assignment.

#Step 5: Script Approval

After configuring the pipeline and before running it for the first time, review the pipeline script for potential script approval requirements.
To check for script approvals, run the pipeline with the "Use Groovy Sandbox" option disabled (Uncheck the box in the pipeline configuration).
The pipeline execution may halt if certain script portions require approval from Jenkins administrators.
Jenkins administrators can access the "Manage Jenkins" > "In-process Script Approval" page to approve the required scripts.
Review the scripts carefully and approve only those that are necessary and from trusted sources.

#Step 6: Save and Run the Pipeline

Click "Save" to save the pipeline configuration.
Click "Build with Parameters" to trigger the pipeline.
Provide values for the parameters when prompted.
The pipeline will execute the stages based on the provided input and manage roles and users accordingly.

#Additional Notes:

Ensure that the Jenkins server has the necessary permissions to manage roles and users using the Role-Based Strategy plugin.
The pipeline assumes that the Jenkins API token is securely stored as a Jenkins credential with the ID JENKINS_API_TOKEN.
The pipeline assumes that the Jenkins server is running on http://localhost:8080/. Modify the JENKINS_URL and JENKINS_USER variables if your Jenkins server is hosted elsewhere or uses a different username.
Make sure to review and test the pipeline before implementing it in a production environment.

#Conclusion:
This SOP outlines the steps to implement a Jenkins pipeline that automates role and user management using the Role-Based Strategy plugin. By following these steps, configuring Jenkins global security settings, enabling user sign-up, setting appropriate permissions for the Jenkins API token, and performing script approval, you can efficiently manage roles and users in Jenkins, ensuring a secure and organized continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) environment.
